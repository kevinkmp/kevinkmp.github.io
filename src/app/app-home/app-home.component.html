<h2>SwiftIQ Sample Shell App</h2>

<p>
  I created this app after reading a bunch of articles and tutorials for <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">
  Angular2</a>. I wanted to see if it was actually as easy as some of the tutorials made it seem.
  For the most part it was. There were a few things that took a bit of researching to figure out,
  most of the time this was due to the articles and videos dealing with now outdated beta versions
  of Angular2.
</p>

<p>
  This sample app was created using the <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">angular-cli</a> tool inside of
  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm</a>. Boy does this ever help to speed things up!
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Navigation Components</b> - I created two components for navigation, nav-primary and nav-secondary.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Class Inheritance</b> - I created two <i>base classes</i>, BaseApplication and BaseApplicationResult. Some of the
    components in this application extend these base classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Nested Components</b> - The "Views" application page has a nested component which acts to show results.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>angular-cli</b> - This tool (which you can run from the terminal inside of WebStorm) makes creating components as
    easy as typing "ng generate component my-sample". Still too long? "ng g c my-sample". This creates a folder
    "my-sample", and inside of the folder it makes four files:<br/>
    my-sample.component.css<br/>
    my-sample.component.html<br/>
    my-sample.component.spec.ts (automatically generated unit tests)<br/>
    my-sample.component.ts (TypeScript file for the component)
  </li>
</ol>

  I've been reading and watching a bunch of links, articles, tutorials and videos in the time leading up to making this
  sample app. I'll link to some of the most helpful here:
